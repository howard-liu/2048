# 2048
Recreation of the popular app 2048 where players match tiles by swiping tiles to one side.

## How to play
To run, in terminal type `python3 2048_Game.py` a 4x4 grid of numbers will pop up. Use WASD to swipe.

## Rules of the game
If a swipe changes the board state, a new number (2 or 4) will spawn on a random empty square. If swipe does not change the board state, then nothing will happen.

If the board fills up entirely, the game will end (this differs from the real game).

When the game ends, it will return the sum of the numbers on screen in your last board state and the program will end.

Happy playing!
